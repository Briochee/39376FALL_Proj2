# Project Description

## Query 1
    - For each compound, compute the number of genes and the number of diseases associated with the compound. Output results with top 5 number of genes in a descending order
## Query 2
    - Compute the number of diseases associated with 1, 2, 3, â€¦, n drugs. Output results with the top 5 number of diseases in a descending order.

## Query 3
    - Get the name of drugs that have the top 5 number of genes. Out put the results.
